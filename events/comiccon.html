        <p class="introduction">
          San Diego Comic-Con International is a comic book convention and
          nonprofit[2] multi-genre entertainment event held annually in San
          Diego, California, United States since 1970. The name, as given on its
          website, is Comic-Con International: San Diego; but it is commonly
          known simply as Comic-Con or the San Diego Comic-Con or "SDCC".
        </p>
        <p class="i2">
          The convention was founded as the Golden State Comic Book Convention
          in 1970 by a group of San Diegans that included Shel Dorf, Richard
          Alf, Ken Krueger, Ron Graf, and Mike Towry;[5][6][7][8][9] later, it
          was called the "San Diego Comic Book Convention", Dorf said during an
          interview that he hoped the first Con would bring in 500
          attendees.[10] It is a four-day event (Thursdayâ€“Sunday) held during
          the summer (in July since 2003) at the San Diego Convention Center in
          San Diego. On the Wednesday evening prior to the official opening,
          professionals, exhibitors, and pre-registered guests for all four days
          can attend a pre-event "Preview Night" to give attendees the
          opportunity to walk the exhibit hall and see what will be available
          during the convention.
        </p>
        <p class="i3">
          Comic-Con International also produces WonderCon, held in Anaheim, and
          SAM: Storytelling Across Media, a conference held in 2016 in San
          Francisco and beginning in 2018 annually at the Comic-Con Museum in
          San Diego. Since 1974, Comic-Con has bestowed its annual Inkpot Award
          on guests and persons of interest in the popular arts industries, as
          well as on members of Comic-Con's board of directors and the
          Convention committee. It is also the home of the Will Eisner Awards.
        </p>
        <p class="i4">
          Originally showcasing primarily comic books and science
          fiction/fantasy related film, television, and similar popular arts,
          the convention has since included a larger range of pop culture and
          entertainment elements across virtually all genres, including horror,
          Western animation, anime, manga, toys, collectible card games, video
          games, webcomics, and fantasy novels. In 2010 and each year
          subsequently, it filled the San Diego Convention Center to capacity
          with more than 130,000 attendees.[11] In addition to drawing huge
          crowds, the event holds several Guinness World Records including the
          largest annual comic and pop culture festival in the world.
        </p>
        <p class="i5">
          Along with panels, seminars, and workshops with comic book
          professionals, there are previews of upcoming feature films and
          portfolio review sessions with top comic book and video game
          companies. The evenings include events such as awards ceremonies, the
          annual Masquerade costume contest, and the Comic-Con International
          Independent Film Festival, which showcases shorts and feature-length
          movies that do not have distribution or distribution deals.
        </p>
        <p class="i6">
          Traditional events include an eclectic film program, screening rooms
          devoted to Japanese animation, gaming, programs such as cartoonist
          Scott Shaw!'s "Oddball Comics" slide show, Quick Draw! hosted by Mark
          Evanier with Shaw!, Sergio Aragones and a guest cartoonist responding
          to improvisational prompts and games (a la Whose Line Is It Anyway?)
          and animation expert Jerry Beck's program featuring TV's "worst
          cartoons ever", as well as over 350 hours of other programming on all
          aspects of comic books and pop culture.
        </p>
        <p class="i7">
          Like most comic book conventions, Comic-Con features a large
          floorspace for exhibitors. These include media companies such as movie
          studios and TV networks, as well as comic-book dealers and
          collectibles merchants. And like most comics conventions, Comic-Con
          includes an autograph area, as well as the Artists' Alley where comics
          artists can sign autographs and sell or do free sketches. Despite the
          name, artists' alleys can include writers and even models.
        </p>
        <p class="i8">
          Academics and comic industry professionals annually hold the Comics
          Arts Conference at Comic-Con, presenting scholarly studies on comics
          as a medium.
          <br />
          In recent years, the number of television shows that are promoted far
          outnumber films. During the 2011 convention, at least 80 TV shows were
          represented, compared to about 35 films.[44] The shows not only
          promote in the exhibit halls, but also use screenings and panels of
          various actors, writers, producers, and others from their shows.
          <br />
          Premium cable channels HBO and Showtime have used the con to promote
          programs like Game of Thrones (HBO), Dexter (Showtime), Shameless
          (Showtime) and True Blood (HBO).
        </p>
        <p class="i11">
          In 2013, there were 1075 total panels held during the convention, the
          plurality of which were anime-focused (29%), followed by comic-focused
          panels (26%). 1036 vendors participated in the convention in 2013.
        </p>
        <p class="i12">
          There are at least 17 separate rooms in the convention center used for
          panels and screenings, ranging in size from 280 seats to 6,100 seats.
          The two biggest are Ballroom 20, which seats approximately 4,900;[48]
          and Hall H, which seats just over 6,100.
        </p>
        <p class="i13">
          The neighboring Hilton Bayfront is also used, with its main ballroom
          (Indigo) seating up to 2,600.[50][51] The other neighboring hotel, the
          Marriott Marquis & Marina, also hosts a lot of Comic-Con activity.
          Among other things, the hotel serves as the anime headquarters and is
          where the nighttime films are shown.
