        <p class="introduction">
          The Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival (commonly called the
          Coachella Festival or simply Coachella) is an annual music and arts
          festival held at the Empire Polo Club in Indio, California, in the
          Coachella Valley in the Colorado Desert. It was co-founded by Paul
          Tollett and Rick Van Santen in 1999, and is organized by Goldenvoice,
          a subsidiary of AEG Presents. The event features musical artists from
          many genres of music, including rock, pop, indie, hip hop and
          electronic dance music, as well as art installations and sculptures.
          Across the grounds, several stages continuously host live music.
        </p>
        <p class="i2">
          The festival's origins trace back to a 1993 concert that Pearl Jam
          performed at the Empire Polo Club while boycotting venues controlled
          by Ticketmaster. The show validated the site's viability for hosting
          large events, leading to the inaugural Coachella Festival being held
          over the course of two days in October 1999, three months after
          Woodstock '99. After no event was held in 2000, Coachella returned on
          an annual basis beginning in April 2001 as a single-day event. In
          2002, the festival reverted to a two-day format. Coachella was
          expanded to a third day in 2007 and eventually a second weekend in
          2012; it is now held on consecutive three-day weekends in April, with
          the same lineup each weekend. Organizers began permitting spectators
          to camp on the grounds in 2003, one of several expansions and
          additions in the festival's history.
        </p>
        <p class="i3">
          Coachella showcases popular and established musical artists as well as
          emerging artists and reunited groups. It is one of the largest, most
          famous, and most profitable music festivals in the United States and
          the world.[4][5] Each Coachella staged from 2013 to 2015 set new
          records for festival attendance and gross revenues. The 2017 festival
          was attended by 250,000 people and grossed $114.6 million. Coachella's
          success led to Goldenvoice establishing additional music festivals at
          the site, including the annual Stagecoach country music festival
          beginning in 2007, the Big 4 thrash metal festival in 2011, and the
          classic rock-oriented Desert Trip in 2016.
        </p>
        <p class="i4">
          During the festival, several stages continuously host live music. Two
          outdoor stages are used, along with several tents named after
          deserts.[129] The primary stages that have been in use since
          Coachella's inception are: Coachella Stage – the main stage that draws
          the largest crowds. This outdoor stage is where the headlining acts
          perform.
          <br />
          Outdoor Theatre – a smaller outdoor stage adjacent to the Coachella
          Stage
          <br />
          Mojave – a mid-size tent named after the Mojave Desert that hosts acts
          across multiple genres and varying stages of development. In 2017, it
          was moved behind an access road. A year later, it received further
          changes, as it was enlarged and moved again, this time to the Sahara's
          previous spot near the rose garden.
          <br />
          Gobi – a mid-size tent named after the Gobi Desert that hosts acts
          across multiple genres and varying stages of development. Like the
          Mojave, it was moved behind an access road in 2017.
          <br />
          Sahara – a large, hangar-like tent named after the Sahara Desert. It
          generally hosts the top electronic dance music acts.[129] In 2013, the
          tent was expanded in size, reaching a height of 80 feet. Further
          changes were made in 2018, as it was built 25 percent larger and
          relocated west from the row of tents near the Empire Polo Club's rose
          garden to a spot on the Eldorado Polo Club near the festival entrance.
          The new location offers more shade and alleviates issues with foot
          traffic.[130][131] The stage was also moved from one of the open ends
          of the structure to one its sides, allowing a wider field of view to
          attendees.
        </p>
        <p class="i5">
          Additional performance areas have been added over time, including:
          <br />
          Yuma – a small indoor tent introduced in 2013 that primarily hosts
          emerging DJs. The tent was intended to be "a sophisticated space that
          dials down the noise and strobe lights in favor of thoughtful sounds
          and underground acts".
          <br />
          Sonora – a small indoor tent introduced in 2017 to host punk rock and
          Latin acts[129]
          <br />
          Heineken House – a small venue introduced in 2014. It was dedicated to
          "legendary musical performances" and "live mash-ups from a wide array
          of musical artists".[133] Originally designed as a walled structure to
          provide a club-like atmosphere, it was redesigned in 2019 to feature
          an open beer garden layout with a slanted roof, eliminating the long
          waiting lines and giving more visibility to attendees.[134]
          <br />
          Despacio – a small indoor tent used in 2016. Co-created by James
          Murphy of LCD Soundsystem, the venue played "slow-simmering disco and
          vintage club music" on vinyl with the intention of creating a joyful
          setting. It featured a 50,000 watt sound system and air
          conditioning.[135][136]
          <br />
          Antarctic – an indoor dome introduced in 2017 to screen 360-degree
          immersive videos. The structure is 120 feet in diameter, features
          11,000 square feet in projection space and air conditioning, and can
          seat 500 people. Obscura Digital produced the film shown in
          2017.[129][137]
          <br />
          Oasis Dome – used in 2006 and 2011
        </p>
        <p class="i6">
          In addition to hosting live music, Coachella is a showcase for visual
          arts, including installation art and sculpture. Many of the pieces are
          interactive, providing a visual treat for attendees.[138] Throughout
          the years, the art has grown in scale and outrageousness.[139] Paul
          Clemente, Coachella's art director since 2009,[140] said, "I think the
          level of detail and finish and artistry and scale and complexity and
          technology, everything is constantly getting notched up, ratcheted up.
          We're obviously constantly trying to, for lack of a better word, (to)
          outdo ourselves and make it better for the fans."[139] In Coachella's
          early years, art was mostly recycled from the previous year's Burning
          Man festival, due to smaller budgets.[140] Between 2010 and 2015,
          Goldenvoice shifted its focus from renting pieces to commissioning
          them specifically for the festival, increasing their budget. Artists
          are given access to the grounds just 10 days before the festival,
          giving them a tight timeframe in which to assemble their pieces.[139]
          Due to the high cost of re-assembly, only about half of them appear
          again outside of Coachella.[138]
        </p>
        <p class="i7">
          Describing the festival's importance to art, Cynthia Washburn of art
          collective Poetic Kinetics said, "With all the exposure here, I think
          Coachella is becoming as attractive for artists as it is for the
          musicians."[141] In 2013, Clemente considered about 300 art proposals,
          the most in the festival's history for the time.[141] Poetic Kinetics
          has designed several giant moving art installations for past Coachella
          festivals, including a snail in 2013 ("Helix Poeticus"), an astronaut
          in 2014 ("Escape Velocity"), and a caterpillar that "metamorphosized"
          into a butterfly in 2015 ("Papilio Merraculous").[142] The collective
          reprised the astronaut for the 2019 festival ("Overview Effect"), with
          weathering affects applied to the design.[143] Some of the works have
          been featured at Art Basel, and involved participants from
          architecture schools, both local and international. A few of the
          visual artists, such as Hotshot the Robot, Robochrist Industries, the
          Tesla Coil (Cauac), Cyclecide, and The Do LaB, alongside avant-garde
          performance troupe Lucent Dossier Experience, have appeared for
          several consecutive years.[citation needed] Poster artist Emek] has
          produced limited edition posters every year since 2007.
