        <p class="introduction">
          Universal Studios Hollywood is a film studio and theme park in the San
          Fernando Valley area of Los Angeles County, California. About 70% of
          the studio lies within the unincorporated county island known as
          Universal City while the rest lies within the city limits of Los
          Angeles, California. It is one of the oldest and most famous Hollywood
          film studios still in use. Its official marketing headline is "The
          Entertainment Capital of LA".[2] It was initially created to offer
          tours of the real Universal Studios sets and is the first of many
          full-fledged Universal Studios Theme Parks located across the world.
          <br />
          <br />
          Outside the theme park, a new, all-digital facility near the Universal
          Pictures backlot was built in an effort to merge all of NBCUniversal's
          West Coast operations into one area. As a result, the current home for
          KNBC, KVEA and NBC News with Noticias Telemundo Los Angeles Bureaus
          with new digital facility is on the Universal lot formerly occupied by
          Technicolor SA. Universal City includes hotels Universal Hilton &
          Towers, the Sheraton Universal Hotel, and Universal CityWalk, which
          offers a collection of shops, restaurants, an 18-screen Universal
          Cinema and a seven-story IMAX theater. In 2017, the park hosted 9.056
          million guests, ranking it 15th in the world and 9th among North
          American parks.
          <br />
          <br />
          Universal Studios Hollywood is split into two areas on different
          levels, connected by a series of escalators called the Starway. These
          areas are known as the Upper lot and Lower lot. As of 2021, Universal
          Studios Hollywood contains ten rides, seven shows, and two play areas.
          Each lot features a collection of rides, shows and attractions as well
          as food, beverage, and merchandise shops.[45][46][47][48]
        </p>
        <h3 class="hupper">Upper Lot</h3>
        <p class="upper">
          The Upper Lot consists of a variety of family-based attractions. The
          theming of the Upper Lot includes a Mission Revival entrance pathway,
          known as Universal Boulevard, that features the large Universal Plaza
          that opened in 2013. There are not as many fully themed lands as there
          are small environments linked together with a common Art Deco theme
          that reflects the glamour of Old Hollywood. Universal Boulevard is
          home to Waterworld: A Live Sea War Spectacular, and the DreamWorks
          Theatre, the latter which currently serves as the main location for
          Kung Fu Panda Adventure, a slightly modified version of Kung Fu Panda:
          Unstoppable Awesomeness from Motiongate Dubai.
          <br />
          <br />
          In a small area north of Universal Boulevard called Production Plaza,
          there are two of the park's longest-running shows called Universal's
          Animal Actors and Special Effects Show.
          <br />
          <br />
          The Upper Lot is also home to the Streets of the World, which opened
          in 1989 and currently contains six streets within. One of the first
          streets - 1950s America - is next door to Universal Plaza, and is a
          dining area home to Palace Deli & Market and Mel's Diner, the latter
          being a replica of the Mel's Drive-In that was featured prominently in
          the Universal classic American Graffiti. The next two streets are
          French Street (a French-themed avenue with quick service dining), and
          the cozy cobblestone-paved Parisian Courtyard. Minion Way is themed
          after the Universal Pictures and Illumination's Despicable Me
          franchise, and features Despicable Me Minion Mayhem, a motion
          simulator ride that takes you into the world of minions. Next door is
          a play area that contains a large outdoor dry and wet play area for
          children named Super Silly Fun Land, in addition to an aerial carousel
          named Silly Swirly Fun Ride. Minion Caf√© and Despicable Delights are
          the two themed eateries in the street. The newest street to be
          included in Streets of the World is Pets Place, a colorful version of
          Manhattan that is based on The Secret Life of Pets franchise and is
          home to the dark ride The Secret Life of Pets: Off the Leash!. The
          final street is Baker Street, which was originally set in old England
          as seen by the fictional detective, Sherlock Holmes. However, between
          2018 and 2021, a great majority of the area has been rethemed as the
          Manhattan-inspired Pets Place, while the remaining facades of Baker
          Street (between Pets Place and Universal Boulevard) are left untouched
          as of 2021.[49][50][51]
        </p>
        <p class="springfield">
          Springfield, U.S.A. is themed to The Simpsons. This area contains The
          Simpsons Ride, a motion simulator ride, along with multiple eateries
          themed to the show, a gift shop themed after Kwik-E-Mart, and several
          character meet and greets.
        </p>
        <p class="tourplaza">
          Right past the Studio Tour Plaza, the Studio Tour attraction is a 45
          to 60 minute ride which uses tram vehicles to take the visitors from
          the Theme Park's Upper Lot to the back-lot where actual filming of
          many shows and movies take place. The tour is the signature ride at
          the theme park and the wait time varies by day and seasons. The tour
          begins with a video introduction by Jimmy Fallon and a trip down the
          hill into the Front Lot. After drifting through the sound stages of
          the Front Lot and transitioning into the Metropolitan Sets of the back
          lot, the tram then takes the guests to Courthouse Square section and
          then other buildings in the back lot. Afterwards, the tram enters a
          tunnel leading to the attraction: King Kong: 360 3-D. Then the tram
          travels through sets from Jurassic Park and encounter Dilophosauruses.
          Following that, the tram travels to the Flash Flood attraction. The
          tram continues through Old Mexico, Six Points Texas, a miniature model
          of the SS Venture from King Kong, and Little Europe before
          experiencing Earthquake: The Big One attraction, movie sets themed as
          Amity Island from Jaws, Whoville from How the Grinch Stole Christmas,
          Bates motel from Psycho, and the crashed plane set from War of the
          Worlds, before leading to the final attraction on the tour, Fast &
          Furious: Supercharged based on the Fast & Furious film franchise.
        </p>
        <p class="hp">
          The Wizarding World of Harry Potter soft-opened February 12, 2016, and
          officially opened April 7, 2016, and is the largest themed area in the
          Upper Lot, featuring the animatronic and screen-based thrill ride
          Harry Potter and the Forbidden Journey, which is housed in a replica
          Hogwarts castle, featuring actual props from the films in the queue.
          In addition, this area includes the family-friendly roller coaster
          Flight of the Hippogriff, and the interactive Ollivander's Wand Show
          where a wand picks a witch or a wizard. Two live shows, Frog Choir and
          Triwizard Spirit Rally, are featured on the outdoor stage. In addition
          to attractions, the themed area features multiple shops, a Hogwarts
          Express train picture spot, The Three Broomsticks restaurant, and a
          variety of outdoor vending carts selling food and drink. Souvenirs and
          food based on the books and films are sold in the area too.[56]
        </p>
        <br />
        <h3 class="hlower">Lower Lot</h3>
        <p class="lower">
          The Lower Lot is the smaller of the two lots. There are three thrill
          rides at this section of the park that each have height restrictions.
          It is home to Jurassic World: The Ride, Revenge of the Mummy: The Ride
          and Transformers: The Ride 3D.[30][58][48] Jurassic World: The Ride,
          is a water adventure ride that takes visitors through the events of
          the film Jurassic World, ending with an 84-foot drop. Outside the ride
          stands the Raptor Encounter, a show that happens throughout the day,
          and the Dino Play jungle gym area for children too small to ride.
          Revenge of the Mummy: The Ride is a high speed indoor roller coaster
          transporting guests through moments reminiscent of the 1999 Mummy
          franchise. Transformers: The Ride 3D uses high tech technology to
          simulate a battle between the Autobots and Decepticons with 4K-3D
          screens and flight simulator ride vehicles. The Lower Lot also
          features several gift shops and quick service restaurants.
