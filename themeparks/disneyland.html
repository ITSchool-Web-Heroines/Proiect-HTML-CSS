        Disneyland Anaheim
      </h1>
      <div class="content">
        <p class="introduction">
          Disneyland is a theme park in Anaheim, California, which opened in
          1955. It is the only one designed and built under the direct
          supervision of Walt Disney. Walt Disney came up with the concept of
          Disneyland after visiting various amusement parks with his daughters
          in the 1930s and 1940s. He initially envisioned building a tourist
          attraction adjacent to his studios in Burbank to entertain fans who
          wished to visit; however, he soon realized that the proposed site was
          too small. After hiring the Stanford Research Institute to perform a
          feasability study determining an appropriate site for his project,
          Disney bought a 160-acre (65 ha) site near Anaheim in 1953. The park
          was designed by a creative team hand-picked by Walt from internal and
          outside talent. They founded WED Enterprises, the precursor to today's
          Walt Disney Imagineering. Construction began in 1954 and the park was
          unveiled during a special televised press event on the ABC Television
          Network on July 17, 1955. Since opening, Disneyland has undergone
          expansions and major renovations, including the addition of New
          Orleans Square in 1966, Bear Country in 1972, Mickey's Toontown in
          1993, and Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge in 2019.[2] Opened in 2001, Disney
          California Adventure Park was built on the site of Disneyland's
          original parking lot. Disneyland has a larger cumulative attendance
          than any other theme park in the world, with 726 million visits since
          it opened (as of December 2018). In 2018, the park had approximately
          18.6 million visits, making it the second most visited amusement park
          in the world that year, behind only Magic Kingdom, the very park it
          inspired.[3] According to a 2005 Disney report, 65,700 jobs are
          supported by the Disneyland Resort, including about 20,000 direct
          Disney employees and 3,800 third-party employees (independent
          contractors or their employees).[4] Disney announced "Project
          Stardust" in 2019, which included major structural renovations to the
          park to account for higher attendance numbers.
          <br />
          <br />
          Disneyland Park consists of nine themed "lands" and a number of
          concealed backstage areas, and occupies over 100 acres (40 ha) with
          the new addition of Mickey and Minnie's Runaway Railway that's coming
          to Mickeys Toontown in 2022.[18] The park opened with Main Street,
          U.S.A., Adventureland, Frontierland, Fantasyland, and Tomorrowland,
          and has since added New Orleans Square in 1966, Bear Country (now
          known as Critter Country) in 1972, and Mickey's Toontown in 1993, and
          Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge in 2019.[57] In 1957, Holidayland opened to
          the public with a nine-acre (3.6 ha) recreation area including a
          circus and baseball diamond, but was closed in late 1961. It is often
          referred to as the "lost" land of Disneyland. Throughout the park are
          "Hidden Mickeys", representations of Mickey Mouse heads inserted
          subtly into the design of attractions and environmental decor. An
          elevated berm supports the 3 ft (914 mm) narrow gauge Disneyland
          Railroad that circumnavigates the park.
        </p>
        <h3 class="hmain">Main Street, U.S.A.</h3>
        <p class="main">
          Main Street, U.S.A. is patterned after a typical Midwest town of the
          early 20th century, and took much inspiration from Walt Disney's
          hometown, Marceline, Missouri.[58] Main Street, U.S.A. has a train
          station, town square, movie theater, city hall, firehouse with a
          steam-powered pump engine, emporium, shops, arcades, double-decker
          bus, horse-drawn streetcar, and jitneys.[59] Main Street is also home
          to the Disney Art Gallery and the Opera House which showcases Great
          Moments with Mr. Lincoln, a show featuring an Audio-Animatronic
          version of the president. At the far end of Main Street, U.S.A. is
          Sleeping Beauty Castle, the Partners statue, and the Central Plaza
          (also known as the Hub), which is a portal to most of the themed
          lands: the entrance to Fantasyland is by way of a drawbridge across a
          moat and through the castle.[60] Adventureland, Frontierland, and
          Tomorrowland are on both sides of the castle. Several lands are not
          directly connected to the Central Plaza—namely, New Orleans Square,
          Critter Country, Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge and Mickey's Toontown.
        </p>
        <h3 class="hadventureland">Adventureland</h3>
        <p class="adventureland">
          Adventureland is designed to recreate the feel of an exotic tropical
          place in a far-off region of the world. "To create a land that would
          make this dream reality", said Walt Disney, "we pictured ourselves far
          from civilization, in the remote jungles of Asia and Africa."
          Attractions include opening day's Jungle Cruise, the Indiana Jones
          Adventure, and Tarzan's Treehouse, which is a conversion of Swiss
          Family Treehouse from the Walt Disney film Swiss Family Robinson. Walt
          Disney's Enchanted Tiki Room which is located at the entrance to
          Adventureland was the first feature attraction to employ
          Audio-Animatronics, a computer synchronization of sound and robotics.
        </p>
        <h3 class="hnew">New Orleans Square</h3>
        <p class="new">
          New Orleans Square is based on 19th-century New Orleans, opened on
          July 24, 1966. It is home to Pirates of the Caribbean and the Haunted
          Mansion, with nighttime entertainment Fantasmic!. This area is the
          home of the private Club 33.
        </p>
        <h3 class="hfrontier">Frontierland</h3>
        <p class="frontier">
          Frontierland recreates the setting of pioneer days along the American
          frontier. According to Walt Disney, "All of us have cause to be proud
          of our country's history, shaped by the pioneering spirit of our
          forefathers. Our adventures are designed to give you the feeling of
          having lived, even for a short while, during our country's pioneer
          days." Frontierland is home to the Pinewood Indians band of
          animatronic Native Americans, who live on the banks of the Rivers of
          America. Entertainment and attractions include Big Thunder Mountain
          Railroad, the Mark Twain Riverboat, the Sailing Ship Columbia,
          Pirate's Lair on Tom Sawyer Island, and Frontierland Shootin'
          Exposition. Frontierland is also home to the Golden Horseshoe Saloon,
          an Old West-style show palace.
        </p>
        <h3 class="hcritter">Critter Country</h3>
        <p class="critter">
          Critter Country opened in 1972 as "Bear Country", and was renamed in
          1988. Formerly the area was home to Indian Village, where indigenous
          tribespeople demonstrated their dances and other customs. Today, the
          main draw of the area is Splash Mountain, a log-flume journey based on
          the animated segments of Disney's 1946 film Song of the South. In
          2003, a dark ride called The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh
          replaced the Country Bear Jamboree, which closed in 2001.
        </p>
        <h3 class="hstar">Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge</h3>
        <p class="star">
          Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge is set within the Star Wars universe, in the
          Black Spire Outpost village on the remote frontier planet of Batuu.
          Attractions include the Millennium Falcon: Smugglers Run and Star
          Wars: Rise of the Resistance.[62] The land opened in 2019, replacing
          Big Thunder Ranch and former backstage areas.[63][64]

          alt="Disneyland"
        />
        <p class="fantasy">
          Fantasyland is the area of Disneyland of which Walt Disney said, "What
          youngster has not dreamed of flying with Peter Pan over moonlit
          London, or tumbling into Alice's nonsensical Wonderland? In
          Fantasyland, these classic stories of everyone's youth have become
          realities for youngsters – of all ages – to participate in."
          Fantasyland was originally styled in a medieval European fairground
          fashion, but its 1983 refurbishment turned it into a Bavarian village.
          Attractions include several dark rides, the King Arthur Carrousel, and
          various family attractions. Fantasyland has the most fiber optics in
          the park; more than half of them are in Peter Pan's Flight.[65]
          Sleeping Beauty's Castle features a walk-through storytelling of Briar
          Rose's adventure as Sleeping Beauty. The attraction opened in 1959,
          was redesigned in 1972, closed in 1992 for reasons of security and the
          new installation of pneumatic ram firework shell mortars for "Believe,
          There's Magic in the Stars", and reopened 2008 with new renditions and
          methods of storytelling and the restored work of Eyvind Earle.

        <h3 class="hmickey">Mickey's Toontown</h3>
        <p class="mickey">
          Mickey's Toontown opened in 1993 and was partly inspired by the
          fictional Los Angeles suburb of Toontown in the Touchstone Pictures
          1988 release Who Framed Roger Rabbit. Mickey's Toontown is based on a
          1930s cartoon aesthetic and is home to Disney's most popular cartoon
          characters. Toontown features two main attractions: Gadget's Go
          Coaster and Roger Rabbit's Car Toon Spin. The "city" is also home to
          cartoon character's houses such as the house of Mickey Mouse, Minnie
          Mouse and Goofy, as well as Donald Duck's boat. The 3 ft (914 mm)
          gauge Jolly Trolley can also be found in this area, though it closed
          as an attraction in 2003 and is now present only for display purposes.
          In 2023 Mickey & Minnie's Runaway Railway will open at Mickey's
          Toontown. The new family-friendly dark ride will increase the size of
          Toontown as well as the size of Disneyland from 99 to 101 acres (40 to
          41 ha). The land is currently closed for refurbishment and will open
          again in 2023.
        </p>
        <h3 class="htomorrow">Tomorrowland</h3>
        <img
          class="image2"

          alt="Disneyland"
        />
        <p class="tomorrow">
          During the 1955 inauguration, Walt Disney dedicated Tomorrowland with
          these words: "Tomorrow can be a wonderful age. Our scientists today
          are opening the doors of the Space Age to achievements that will
          benefit our children and generations to come. The Tomorrowland
          attractions have been designed to give you an opportunity to
          participate in adventures that are a living blueprint of our future."
          Disneyland producer Ward Kimball had rocket scientists Wernher von
          Braun, Willy Ley, and Heinz Haber serve as technical consultants
          during the original design of Tomorrowland.[66] Initial attractions
          included Rocket to the Moon, Astro-Jets and Autopia; later, the first
          incarnation of the Submarine Voyage was added. The area underwent a
          major transformation in 1967 to become New Tomorrowland, and then
          again in 1998 when its focus was changed to present a "retro-future"
          theme reminiscent of the illustrations of Jules Verne. Current
          attractions include Space Mountain, Star Wars Launch Bay, Autopia,
          Jedi Training: Trials of the Temple, the Disneyland Monorail
          Tomorrowland Station, Astro Orbitor, and Buzz Lightyear Astro
          Blasters. Finding Nemo Submarine Voyage opened on June 11, 2007,
          resurrecting the original Submarine Voyage which closed in 1998. Star
          Tours was closed in July 2010 and replaced with Star Tours–The
          Adventures Continue in June 2011.
