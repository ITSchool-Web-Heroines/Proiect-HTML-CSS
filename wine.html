        <p class="introduction">
          California wine production has a rich viticulture history since 1680
          when Spanish Jesuit missionaries planted Vitis vinifera vines native
          to the Mediterranean region in their established missions to produce
          wine for religious services. In the 1770s, Spanish missionaries
          continued the practice under the direction of the Father Junípero
          Serra who planted California's first vineyard at Mission San Juan
          Capistrano.[4][2]
        </p>
        <p class="i2">
          Its contemporary wine production grew steadily since the end of
          Prohibition, but mostly known for its sweet port-style and jug wine
          products. As the market favored French brands, California’s table wine
          business grew modestly,[5] but quickly gained international prominence
          at the Paris Wine Tasting of 1976, when renown French oenophiles, in a
          blind tasting, ranked the California wines higher than the primer
          French labels in the Chardonnay (white) and Cabernet Sauvignon (red)
          categories.[6] The result caused a ‘shock’ in viticulture industry
          since France was regarded as foremost producer of the world's finest
          table wines. This revolutionary event attributed to expanding the
          recognition and prestige of vintners in the New World, specifically,
          the Golden State.[7]
        </p>
        <p class="i3">
          The state produces about ninety percent of the American wine supply
          and is the fourth largest wine producer among the world's independent
          nations.[8][9] California has more than 4,200 wineries ranging from
          home-grown and small boutiques to large corporations with
          international distribution, and even more vineyards and growers, at
          close to 6,000
        </p>
        <p class="i4">
          California has over 427,000 acres (1,730 km2) planted under vines
          mostly located in a stretch of land covering over 700 miles (1,100 km)
          from Mendocino County to the southwestern tip of Riverside County.
          There are over 107 American Viticultural Areas (AVAs), including the
          well-known Napa, Russian River Valley, Rutherford and Sonoma Valley
          AVAs. The Central Valley is California's largest wine region
          stretching for 300 miles (480 km) from the Sacramento Valley south to
          the San Joaquin Valley. This one region produces nearly 75% of all
          California wine grapes and includes many of California's bulk, box and
          jug wine producers like Gallo, Franzia and Bronco Wine Company.[8]
        </p>
        <p class="i5">
          The wine regions of California are often divided into 4 main
          regions:[16]
          <br />
          <br />
          North Coast – Includes most of North Coast, California, north of San
          Francisco Bay. The large North Coast AVA covers most of the region.
          Notable wine regions include Napa Valley and Sonoma County and the
          smaller sub AVAs within them. Mendocino and Lake County are also part
          of this region.
          <br />
          <br />
          Central Coast – Includes most of the Central Coast of California and
          the area south and west of San Francisco Bay down to Santa Barbara
          County. The large Central Coast AVA covers the region. Notable wine
          regions in this area include Santa Clara Valley AVA, San Francisco Bay
          AVA, Santa Cruz Mountains AVA, San Lucas AVA, Paso Robles AVA, Santa
          Maria Valley AVA, Santa Ynez Valley AVA, Edna Valley AVA, Arroyo
          Grande Valley AVA, Livermore Valley AVA, Cienega Valley AVA and San
          Benito AVA.
          <br />
          <br />
          South Coast – Includes portion of Southern California, namely the
          coastal regions south of Los Angeles down to the border with Mexico.
          Notable wine regions in this area include Temecula Valley AVA,
          Antelope Valley/Leona Valley AVA, San Pasqual Valley AVA and Ramona
          Valley AVA. Also, wineries in the San Luis Rey Valley are in the
          process of creating a new AVA specific to that area.
          <br />
          <br />
          Central Valley – Includes California's Central Valley and the Sierra
          Foothills AVA. Notable wine regions in this area include the Lodi AVA.
        </p>
        <p class="i6">
          Over one hundred grape varieties are grown in California including
          French, Italian and Spanish as well as hybrid grapes and new vitis
          vinifera varieties developed at the UC Davis Department of Viticulture
          and Enology. The seven leading grape varieties are:[8]
          <br />
          Cabernet Sauvignon
          <br />
          Chardonnay
          <br />
          Merlot
          <br />
          Pinot noir
          <br />
          Sauvignon blanc
          <br />
          Syrah
          <br />
          Zinfandel
        </p>
        <p class="i7">
          Other important red wine grapes include Barbera, Cabernet Franc,
          Carignan, Grenache, Malbec, Mourvèdre, Petite Sirah, Petit Verdot,
          Sangiovese, and Tannat. Important white wine varietals include Chenin
          blanc, French Colombard, Gewürztraminer, Marsanne, Muscat Canelli,
          Pinot blanc, Pinot gris, Riesling, Roussane, Sémillon, Trousseau gris,
          and Viognier.[17]
        </p>
        <p class="i8">
          Up until the late 1980s, the Californian wine industry was dominated
          by the Bordeaux varietals and Chardonnay. Sales began to drop as wine
          drinkers grew bored[citation needed] with the familiarity of these
          wines. Groups of winemakers like Rhône Rangers and a new wave of
          Italian winemakers dubbed "Cal-Ital" reinvigorated the industry with
          new wine styles made from different varieties like Syrah, Viognier,
          Sangiovese and Pinot grigio. The Santa Cruz-based Bonny Doon Vineyard
          was one of the first wineries to promote these grape varieties in
          California actively. The large variety of wine grapes also encourages
          a large variety of wines. California produces wines made in nearly
          every single known wine style including sparkling, dessert and
          fortified wines.[8] In the early 21st century, vintners have begun
          reviving heirloom grape varieties, such as Trousseau gris and
          Valdiguié.
