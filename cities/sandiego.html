        <p class="introduction">
          San Diego's coastal seat makes it an ideal destination for adventurers
          and sun seekers. Whether you're hiking along the sandstone cliffs of
          Torrey Pines State Natural Reserve, walking through the frothy surf of
          Coronado Beach or admiring the postcard-worthy scenery at La Jolla
          Cove, you'll find little reason to stray far from the city's natural
          wonders. Spend a day at Balboa Park – the city's definitive culturual
          hub – and soak up the stunning setting while exploring the many
          museums, theaters and gardens that call this 1,200-acre park home.
          Though it's tempting to spend your whole vacation exploring, don't
          forget to carve out some time for a San Diego history lesson:
          America's Finest City proudly shows off its military and maritime
          heritage with two well-regarded (and highly interactive) museums. And
          for a local's perspective, consider signing up for a guided tour (San
          Diego is home to some of the best California tours). For a view of the
          city from the water, a boat tour, Jet Ski outing or fishing charter is
          your best bet.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h3 class="hbalboa">Balboa Park</h3>
        <p class="balboa">
          Home to the renowned San Diego Zoo. this 1,200-acre park is the city's
          cultural hub. Located in downtown San Diego (about 2 miles north of
          the city center), Balboa Park is a great place for a stroll, bike ride
          or picnic. Wander around the park's many gardens while admiring the
          intricate Spanish-Renaissance architecture that permeates the grounds
          (the best examples are the California Building and the House of
          Hospitality). The Botanical Building is a great starting point in
          Balboa Park. The building is one of the most photographed places in
          Balboa Park and is one of the largest lath structures in the world.
          But don't just look at it. The famous botanical building features more
          than 2,100 permanent plants, including striking collections of
          tropical plants and orchids. The park also features a cactus garden,
          rose garden, a Japanese-style garden as well as a palm tree canyon,
          among many others. But if you find yourself growing antsy just walking
          around and smelling the roses, there are plenty of attractions located
          here (many of them free). Take in a show at the Tony Award-winning Old
          Globe Theatre, visit the Spreckels Organ Pavilion to see one of the
          world's largest outdoor pipe organs, or the Marie Hitchcock Puppet
          Theater if you got the kiddos in tow. Museums are just as aplenty,
          with enough to suit all types of interests. Art lovers will enjoy the
          San Diego Museum of Art, the Museum of Photographic Arts and Mingei
          International Museum while science enthusiasts will enjoy the Fleet
          Science Center and the Museum of Man. If you're traveling as a family,
          take some time to check out the San Diego Air & Space Museum or the
          San Diego Model Railroad Museum, the world's largest operating model
          railroad museum. There's also an automotive museum and the San Diego
          Hall of Champions Sports Museum, dedicated entirely to San Diego's
          sports history.
        </p>
        <h3 class="hmission">Mission Beach and Pacific Beach</h3>
        <p class="mission">
          Mission Beach and Pacific Beach are one giant, connected shoreline in
          San Diego. While not as pristine as Coronado Beach, the area is just
          as popular thanks to all the nearby attractions and amenities. This
          miles-long stretch of sand fits the SoCal stereotype to a T: throngs
          of surfers and bikini-clad sunbathers crowd the shores every summer,
          while the nearby boardwalk is usually packed with inline skaters and
          bicyclists. The beach is a popular spot in San Diego for surfing as
          well, offering swells both high and low, perfect for beginners and
          seasoned surfers. You'll find numerous water sports equipment rental
          shops strewn around the neighborhood, offering everything from Jet
          Skis to kayaks. Belmont Park, which acts as the border between the two
          beaches, is a beachfront amusement park featuring arcades and numerous
          rides, including the Giant Dipper wooden roller coaster – a more than
          100-year-old National Historic Landmark. When lunchtime rolls around,
          head to one of the many beachside eateries that flank the boardwalk or
          Mission Boulevard (the area's main thoroughfare), or have a picnic at
          Bonita Cove, the bayfront park located across the street from Belmont
          Park. The difference between the two is discernible. While they both
          share the same boardwalk, sand and ocean, Pacific Beach and Mission
          Beach share key differences. Mission Beach, which begins at Belmont
          Park going south, is the calmer of the two. The boardwalk has more
          homes than hotels and far fewer amenities than Pacific Beach, making
          it good for families or those seeking a more relaxed beach experience.
          Pacific Beach, which starts north of Belmont Park, is much more
          lively. Mission Boulevard, the main thoroughfare, is lined with
          restaurants, surf shops, retail stores, hotels and bars. The further
          you go up Mission Boulevard the further you go into the belly of the
          beast that is Pacific Beach. Next to the Gaslamp Quarter, Pacific
          Beach is the best place for nightlife in San Diego, known for getting
          particularly rowdy. Aside from Mission Boulevard, you can find a heavy
          concentration of bars and nightlife options on Garnet Avenue and Grand
          Avenue. If you don't want to experience this side of Pacific Beach,
          take a walk along Crystal Pier or stick to the beach north of this
          pier.
        </p>
        <h3 class="hcoronado">Coronado Beach</h3>
        <p class="coronado">
          Compared to Mission Beach, this popular shoreline boasts fewer
          sunbathers and calmer waves. Just across the bay from San Diego,
          Coronado Beach is popular with families and couples alike thanks to
          its miles-long shoreline (affording plenty of room for beachgoers),
          clean sands, peaceful atmosphere and idyllic location in the "Crown
          City" (in Spanish, "Coronado" means "crowned one"). While you won't
          have access to a bustling boardwalk (like that at Mission Beach), you
          will have plenty of picturesque scenery to admire (besides the surf):
          magnificent mansions sit behind the beach on Ocean Boulevard. And the
          historic Hotel del Coronado – a 130-year-old National Historic
          Landmark – is perched just beyond the sand. When you're not boogie
          boarding or building a sand castle, heed the advice of recent visitors
          and simply walk the 1.5-mile-long shoreline. Even if you're visiting
          San Diego during the city's winter season (December through February)
          when the water is a little too chilly for swimming, you should still
          plan to make a stop here for the scenery. (Or plan to drive by on a
          Jet Ski.) And if you enjoy ice skating, the Hotel Del offers the
          unique opportunity to ice skate right along the beach. Past travelers
          recommend venturing to the beach at sunset for the most incredible
          views. You'll find plenty of bathroom and shower facilities at the
          beach, plus sand volleyball courts and fire pits for evening s'mores.
          The beach is located nearly 2 miles south of the Coronado Ferry
          Landing. You can walk, drive or catch the 901 bus from Third Street to
          the beach. This bus also picks up from downtown San Diego on Front
          Street at the corner of West A Street. A few of the best San Diego
          tours also make stop here. The shoreline is patrolled by lifeguards
          from 9 a.m. to dusk daily on the main stretch of the beach but
          seasonal lifeguards are staffed in farther sections of the beach
          during summer. There is a curfew observed from 11 p.m. to 6 a.m.
          daily. Parking and entrance is free.
        </p>
        <br />

        <h3 class="hgaslamp">Gaslamp Quarter</h3>
        <p class="gaslamp">
          Want to see what San Diego looked like at its founding? It's at the
          Torrey Pines State Natural Reserve. This oceanfront reserve features
          1,750 acres of unspoiled land, protecting the unique topography and
          various types of flora present from way back when, including the
          Torrey Pine, America's rarest pine tree. There are 3,000 Torrey Pines
          in the reserve alone and aside from San Diego, the only other place in
          the country the pines grows are on Santa Rosa Island off the coast of
          Santa Barbara. The reserve also houses one of Southern California's
          last salt marshes and waterfowl refuges. What does that mean for you?
          Plenty of hiking opportunities (8 miles to be exact). Trails offer a
          chance to get up close and personal with the attraction's famously
          beautiful sandstone ravines and badlands as well as breathtaking views
          of the coastline. And if you come during the spring, you'll see
          wildflowers on full display. Popular trails include the brief Guy
          Fleming Trail (0.7 miles round trip), which features two ocean
          overlooks, and the longer Razor Point Trail (1.4 miles round trip),
          which tours more of the sandstone geological features of the reserve.
          There is also the beach trail that leads to Torrey Pines stunning
          stretch of shore. Of all San Diego's beaches, a long walk along Torrey
          Pines State Beach is a must simply for its views of the towering
          sandstone cliffs that border it. Keep in mind that along these bluffs
          there are no lifeguards on duty and the ocean can be rough, so swim at
          your own risk. Also the cliffs can be unstable, so set up close to the
          shore.
        </p>
        <h3 class="hold">Old Town San Diego</h3>
        <p class="old">
          Take a trip back in time at Old Town San Diego State Historic Park, a
          mile-long stretch of restored shops and houses on the grounds of the
          first European settlement in California. Widely considered the
          "birthplace of California," Old Town San Diego shows visitors what it
          was like to live through different eras of California history, from
          the time of Spanish explorers to the California gold rush. Some
          important stops include the Whaley House, a former granary and
          courthouse which was originally built in 1857, and Casa de Estudillo,
          a house built in the 1820s which utilizes traditional furniture and
          decor to illustrate how people lived years ago. The Junípero Serra
          Museum, named for the Spanish monk who helped colonize San Diego and
          other areas of California, is also a must-see because its architecture
          and location have helped make it a famous San Diego landmark. It sits
          on a hill in Presidio Park near green spaces, picnic areas and
          memorials, and it provides great views of the city and the Pacific
          Ocean. There are plenty of shops in the Old Town area, many of which
          sell handcrafted items from Mexico and other Latin American countries.
          The town's Mexican heritage is also preserved through the various
          restaurants that dish out authentic Mexican food and often hand out
          homemade tortillas for travelers to sample. Previous visitors enjoyed
          simply strolling through the streets, relaxing on the green spaces and
          listening to mariachi bands. For a little help navigating the area,
          sign up for one of the best San Diego tours. Admission to the Old Town
          State Historic Park and the individual museums is free of charge.
          However, some museums, such as the Junípero Serra Museum, encourage
          small donations upon entrance. Free parking is available on-site.
          Museums are open from 10 a.m. until 5 p.m. but from October to April,
          they close at 4 p.m. on weekdays. For more information, visit the Old
          Town San Diego website.

        <h3 class="hzoo">San Diego Zoo and Safari Park</h3>
        <img
          class="image"
          src="https://img1.10bestmedia.com/Images/Photos/94573/p-san-diego-zoo_55_660x440_201405302322.jpg"
          alt="San Diego Zoo"
        />
        <p class="zoo">
          This 100-acre establishment is one of the most famous zoos in the
          country. The San Diego Zoo is not only one of the largest zoos in the
          USA but also houses one of the largest collections of rare and
          endangered animals in the world (3,500 to be exact). Giant pandas,
          giraffes, elephants, polar bears, and koalas (the largest collection
          outside of Australia) are just a few of the many animals that call the
          San Diego Zoo home. The exhibits are linked by an expansive series of
          trails such as the Monkey Trail, Hippo Trail or Tiger Trail. On these
          designated pathways, you'll come face to face with numerous exciting
          creatures including hippos in the Lost Forest, arctic foxes in the
          Northern Frontier, rhinos in the Urban Jungle or gators in the
          Wegeforth Bowl. You'll need plenty of energy – and a map – to see
          everything the zoo has to offer. Should your feet grow weary while
          exploring, the zoo offers a 35-minute guided bus tour of the park.
          There's also the Skyfari aerial tram that transports visitors from one
          end of the park to the other, offering a birds-eye-view of the
          exhibits below in between. In addition to plenty of animals to see,
          the zoo also hosts animal shows and animal encounter programs daily as
          well as 4-D movie theaters with educational films about the wildlife.
          If you want more of the zoo, head about 32 miles north to the Safari
          Park in Escondido. Here you can view some of Africa's most beloved
          animals – including lions, elephants and cheetahs – roaming free
          (well, relatively). There's also meerkats, zebras, gorillas and bald
          eagles, to name a few. True to its name, the park offers a variety of
          different safaris, including a zipline safari and a caravan safari.
          Travelers almost unanimously agree that the San Diego Zoo is the best
          zoo they have ever been to. Recent visitors to the park were impressed
          with the vast amount of animals to see, the various things to do and
          how close they were able to get to the animals. Many said with all
          that's available, a day wasn't enough to see everything – the park is
          really that big. Travelers say bring really good walking shoes, as the
          distance between some exhibits is as much of a 20 minute walk. Some
          recommended hopping on the Kangaroo bus (for an extra fee) that stops
          at four different places in the park or taking the Skyfari just for
          the views alone. Even though there is lots of walking involved, and
          some admitted admission is steep, visitors say the experience was more
          than worth it. The same sentiment is shared for the Safari Park.
          Visitors say it is an inconvenient trek, but the unique habitat
          created for the animals is very fascinating to see. Some travelers
          even went so far to say that it felt like they were on a real African
          safari. The San Diego Zoo is located in the northwest corner of Balboa
          Park. Hours for both the zoo and park vary by season, so consult the
          zoo's website for the most up-to-date information on opening and
          closing times. Admission is a bit pricey – $56 for adults ages 12 and
          older $46 and for kids ages 3 to 11 – especially for families. You
          don't need your own set of wheels to reach the zoo; the Rapid 215 and
          Route 7 (which stop at Broadway downtown) bus stops there. However, if
          you're hoping to visit the Safari Park, you'll either need to drive or
          take a taxi as the city doesn't offer an efficient mode of public
          transportation between the zoo and park. Parking at the zoo is free.

        <h3 class="hseaport">Seaport Village</h3>
        <p class="seaport">
          If you want to spend the afternoon watching ships float in and out of
          the harbor while sipping coffee or shopping for souvenirs, Seaport
          Village is the place to visit. Located on the waterfront not far from
          the USS Midway Museum, the 14-acre village is home to more than 50
          shops and 13 dining outlets. Travelers can enjoy browsing summer
          clothing at Seaport Island Fashion, artwork at Wyland Galleries and
          eco-friendly products at Cariloha Bamboo. Hot Licks, a hot sauce shop,
          is also a crowd favorite. With this much variety, you're sure to find
          something special to remember your San Diego trip. Even visitors who
          aren't particularly fond of shopping said they still enjoyed strolling
          through the sunny outdoor complex. What's more, it's a popular
          jumping-off point for some of the best California tours within San
          Diego. Once you've worked up an appetite, explore Seaport Village's
          diverse food scene. Slurp oysters at the Harbor House, sample
          authentic Mexican flavors at Margarita's Kitchen & Cantina or satisfy
          your sweet tooth at Frost Me Gourmet Cupcakes. If you're looking for
          panoramic sea views, be sure to grab a bite at San Diego Pier Café.
          And at the end of the day, Seaport Village is a great place to watch
          the sun set over the Pacific.

        <h3 class="hcabrillo">Cabrillo National Monument</h3>
        <p class="cabrillo">
          The southernmost tip of Point Loma is where you'll find the Cabrillo
          National Monument. The statue depicts Juan Rodriguez Cabrillo who, in
          1542, was the first European explorer to navigate the Californian
          coast. Situated about 10 miles southwest of downtown San Diego, this
          monument is much more than just a memorializing effigy. The main
          reason people make the journey to the monument is its incredible
          views. From the Cabrillo Monument, you can enjoy sweeping views of the
          Pacific as well as the Point Loma naval base below (where Cabrillo
          initially docked his ships), downtown San Diego, Coronado, and on a
          clear day, the mountains of Tijuana, Mexico. Once you've gotten your
          fill from the top, walk or drive down Cabrillo Road to experience the
          Point Loma Tide Pools (best experienced during the winter months), or
          take a scenic walk along the adjacent bluffs. There's also the
          2.5-mile Bayside Trail that cascades down into the east side of the
          point and ends right above the bay waters. For those more interested
          in the historical aspect of the attraction, the NPS site features
          ranger-guided talks further explaining the story behind the Cabrillo
          Monument as well as the restored Old Point Loma Lighthouse, located a
          short walk south from the monument on Humphreys Road. Recent visitors
          proclaim that this is the best view in San Diego. Travelers also
          strongly recommended taking advantage of the trails and especially the
          tide pools. Some even said to make sure to plan your trip around the
          low tide to best see the creatures that dwell within. Others enjoyed
          learning about the history of the monument the most, saying a trip to
          the visitors center enhanced their experience. The Cabrillo National
          Monument is open to the public every day from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.
          Admission is $20 per vehicle and $10 per person for walk-ins and
          bicyclists. While public transportation stops here, getting to the
          Cabrillo Monument from downtown will be lengthy. You'd have to take
          the trolley from downtown to Old Town Transit Center then take the 28
          bus to connect to the 84 bus that drops off at the monument. It's
          important to note to take caution while exploring the tide pools.
          During high tide, do not attempt to traverse the rocky areas to get
          from one tide pool to the next. The water at the beach is also not
          safe for swimming. For more information, visit the Cabrillo National
          Monument website.

        <p class="uss">
          San Diego is a big military town. You'll likely see bases scattered
          about while exploring the city, especially around parts of the San
          Diego Bay. The USS Midway is one of these affiliated sites that offers
          an insider's look into what is normally closed off to the public. The
          USS Midway is the longest-serving American aircraft carrier of the
          20th century, having played host to 225,000 sailors over the course of
          its life. This historical relic offers patrons the opportunity to
          explore 60 different exhibits and 29 restored aircraft aboard,
          including some that have flown in World War II, Operation Desert Storm
          and the Korean War. During the self-guided audio tour, you'll see the
          crew's sleeping quarters, the engine room, the ship's jail and the
          primary flight control room, among other areas of the 4-acre flight
          deck. There are also flight simulators, fo'c'sle knot tying
          demonstrations and a cafe when you start to feel peckish on-site.
          Travelers say the audio guides are informative, but they also
          recommend stopping to listen to the knowledgeable volunteer docents
          (many of them military veterans, some of which served on the ship)
          stationed throughout the museum. There is so much to see and learn,
          many visitors reported spending several hours here while some ended up
          staying the entire day. Even if you aren't necessarily a history buff,
          those with little interest in the attraction before visiting called it
          a must-see. Many were keen to note how much the USS Midway made them
          appreciate the military members past and present for their service.
          Because this is one of San Diego's most popular attractions, it's best
          to get here early to avoid ticket lines and crowds. You'll find the
          USS Midway Museum located about half a mile south of the Maritime
          Museum on North Harbor Drive. The museum is open daily (except
          Thanksgiving and Christmas Day) from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Last admission
          is at 4 p.m. Tickets for adults cost $23; senior admission is $19;
          children (ages 6 to 12) and retired military get in for $10. Save $1
          on each admission by purchasing tickets on the museum's website.

        <p class="sunset">
          Next to the Cabrillo Monument, travelers say this is the next best
          place for ocean views in Point Loma. Situated a little more than 9
          miles due west of downtown San Diego, Sunset Cliffs stretches across
          68 acres and runs 1.5 miles along Point Loma peninsula's western
          shoreline. The dramatic sandstone cliffs and untouched vegetation
          along with its stunning ocean vistas make for an unforgettable stroll
          both during the day and at night. The area is also home to a few
          secluded beaches as well, though getting to them can be tricky. There
          is a beach popular with locals at the beginning of Cordova Street off
          of Sunset Cliffs Boulevard, but you have to traverse down the rocky
          bluffs to get there. For an easier descent, head to the end of Sunset
          Cliffs Boulevard at Ladera Street and take a walk down the available
          stairway. It won't lead you to the beach but it will get you just
          above the crashing waves. That area is pretty popular with surfers, so
          expect to see lots of locals catching waves. If you venture farther up
          into Sunset Cliffs Natural Park, you'll find plenty of walking trails
          right along the ocean and through the coastal scrub that dot the area.
          As its name implies, sunset is a popular time to visit the park and
          recent visitors say arguably the best. If you want to avoid the crowds
          at dusk, try to plan a mid-week trip rather than a weekend visit.
          Travelers recommend bringing along a sweatshirt in case the ocean
          breeze gets a little too chilly. Past visitors also suggest using the
          restroom before stopping here as there are no facilities on-site. You
          can get to Sunset Cliffs via public transportation. If you're staying
          downtown, take the trolley to Old Town Transit Center then catch the
          35 bus and it will take you to the beginning of the cliffs. Sunset
          Cliffs has no opening or closing hours, though it's best to go when
          there's light for maximum visibility. People have had accidents
          falling off of the cliffs, so be sure to observe the signs marking
          unstable cliffs.

        <h3 class="hpetco">Petco Park</h3>
        <p class="petco">
          Often considered one of the top baseball stadiums in the country,
          Petco Park is a must-visit for San Diego Padres fans or for anyone who
          wants to witness a baseball game and take in the striking San Diego
          skyline. The park, which was built in 2004, sits beside the city's
          historic Gaslamp Quarter and offers visitors views of San Diego's East
          Village. The stadium reflects its Southern California location through
          the light sandstone exterior and decorative palm trees and vegetation,
          as well as through its diverse dining options. Those who work up an
          appetite cheering on the team can snack on fish tacos, sashimi or kale
          quinoa salad in addition to typical ballpark bites like hot dogs and
          hamburgers. Visitors say the food selection is one of the highlights
          of the ballpark, and some locals admit to attending games simply for
          the tasty grub. San Diego's notoriously sunny and dry weather also
          makes Petco Park an ideal baseball stadium: The Padres rarely see home
          games rained out, so it's highly unlikely visitors will need worry
          about their plans getting canceled. The stadium offers tours for
          anyone who wants to learn more about the ins and outs of the park. The
          daily tours highlight the press box, the dugout, the Padres Hall of
          Fame and more. Tours last about 80 minutes and tickets cost $20 for
          adults and $17 for seniors, members of the military and kids 12 and
          younger. Visitors can purchase tickets online or in-person at the
          Western Metal Supply Building Ticket Windows on Seventh Ave and K
          Street up to 30 minutes before the tour starts. The tour schedule
          differs, depending on game days, but any interested travelers can find
          the times on the ballpark's official website. On game days, visitors
          can pay $25 for a pregame tour. These tours cover most of the same
          sights as the daily tours but also let visitors witness the excitement
          and energy of game preparation. The Padres play at Petco Park
          throughout the typical MLB season from April to October. Single game
          tickets start around $15 but increase depending on the day, the
          opposing team and the seating location. Of course, the seats closest
          to the field provide a great viewing experience, but many say the
          views of the field and the city skyline from the upper decks rival
          those of the lower seats. Parking at Petco Park can be reserved
          online, and prices range from $10 to $35 based on proximity to the
          stadium. Visitors willing to get some exercise can also park at
          various garage locations in the Gaslamp Quarter and surrounding
          neighborhoods, and walk to the stadium. For more information, check
          out the San Diego Padres official website.
