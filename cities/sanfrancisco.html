          San Francisco may only stretch across 7 miles, but it's packed with an
          assortment of activities that's sure to please outdoorsy types,
          foodies and curious wanderers of all ages. The Golden Gate Bridge is a
          must-see, while a visit to Alcatraz Island to tour the infamous and
          now closed federal prison should also be high on your list. Instead of
          spending all your time around the touristy Fisherman's Wharf, you can
          discover a more authentic side of San Francisco by grabbing a bite at
          the Ferry Building Marketplace or with a walking tour through the
          vibrant Castro. And whether it's climbing to the top of Twin Peaks or
          sauntering through Golden Gate Park, active types and nature lovers
          will find plenty to love about San Francisco. You'll likely hit these
          top spots and more on a guided tour of the city.

        <h3 class="hsciences">California Academy of Sciences</h3>
        <p class="sciences">
          Attention all traveling families: recent visitors said this is the
          perfect place to bring kids in San Francisco. The California Academy
          of Sciences brims with plenty of things to see, including an aquarium,
          a planetarium, a natural history museum and even a rainforest. The
          Steinhart Aquarium is home to about 40,000 animals representing more
          than 900 different species, including a penguin colony from Africa, a
          swamp with an albino alligator, a shark lagoon and a separate
          100,000-gallon tank that mirrors the ecosystem of the California
          coast. Meanwhile, the Osher Rainforest houses 1,600 animals, including
          250 free-flying birds and about 100 reptiles and amphibians in its
          four-story complex. The Morrison Planetarium is known for its
          75-foot-diameter screen, which screens "Tour of the Universe" shows
          daily. And the Kimball Natural History Museum boasts dinosaur fossils,
          an interactive science exhibit and a unique earthquake simulator. On
          top of all of the permanent exhibits, each attraction features its own
          program of presentations and activities. Travelers suggest sticking
          around for the coral reef dive at the aquarium or venturing into the
          Shake House, the earthquake simulator found at the Kimball Natural
          History Museum. Admission may be pricey to some (adult tickets start
          at $39.95; entrance for children costs between $29.95 and $34.95,
          depending on age), but travelers say their experience was worth the
          cost. Visitors were impressed with not only the quantity of things to
          do, but the quality, with those young and old saying they left amazed
          at what they were able to see and do in a day. And a day is what
          you'll need to see everything, so make sure to pick and choose ahead
          of time if you're on a tight schedule. You can find the California
          Academy of Sciences in Golden Gate Park, along Nancy Pelosi Drive.
          There are multiple public transportation links around the park, but
          the closest to the California Academy of Sciences is the Irving St. &
          9th Ave. Muni metro stop. The academy is open from 9:30 a.m. to 5 p.m.
          Monday through Saturday and 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. on Sundays. For more
          information on the California Academy of Sciences, consult its

        <h3 class="hgolden">Golden Gate Bridge</h3>
        <p class="golden">
          The Golden Gate Bridge's vaulting, orange arches amidst the rocky
          seascape of the San Francisco Bay have made it one of the West Coast's
          most enduring symbols and the city's most popular tourist attraction.
          The bridge's name, "Golden Gate," actually refers to the body of water
          it spans (the Golden Gate Strait that connects the Pacific Ocean with
          the San Francisco Bay), and was built to make travel between San
          Francisco and Marin County an easier feat. There are plenty of great
          spots to capture a snap of the majestic bridge. But if you want a
          truly postcard-worthy shot, head to the Golden Gate Bridge Vista
          Point, situated high on a hill overlooking San Francisco. If you have
          extra time, make sure to explore the Golden Gate National Recreation
          Area. The actual span of the Golden Gate National Recreation Area
          encompasses multiple places in San Mateo (south of San Francisco), San
          Francisco and Marin Counties (Alcatraz and Muir Woods included), but
          notable parts of this recreation area can be found just a stroll away
          from the Golden Gate. From the bridge, travelers will find some
          scenic, bayside trails, some of which lead to secluded beaches,
          including Kirby Cove and Black Sands Beach. If you really want a trek,
          journey to the Point Bonita Lighthouse for sweeping views of the bay,
          found at the very tip of the Golden Gate Strait. Like many travelers
          who came before them, recent visitors were awestruck by the incredible
          architecture of the Golden Gate Bridge as well as the incredible views
          it affords. Some visitors made sure to point out to drivers not to
          turn right (heading towards the Marin County side) to the first
          lookout point, as it is crowded with tourists. Instead, venture into
          the hills for more space and greater photo ops. Travelers also
          suggested walking across the bridge for a scenic stroll (if it's not
          too windy or crowded). If you want to let someone else do the driving,
          consider signing up for an organized bus tour – many of which traverse
          the bridge. And for a completely different perspective, consider one
          of the city's best boat tours – many of which sail beneath the bridge.
          The bridge is accessible all day every day by bus, car, bicycle or on
          foot. If you drive, parking is available but very limited and
          accessible on both the north and south ends of the bridge. The
          Northeast Side Parking Lot is free up to four hours, while the
          Southeast Side Visitor Parking Lot costs about $1 an hour. If you
          drive, you may be subject to a toll. Tolls are only assessed if you're
          traveling from Marin County into San Francisco. The tolls are taken
          electronically only and are $7.50 or $6.50 if you have a FasTrak
          account. For more information on how to pay your toll, and more about
          visiting the Golden Gate Bridge, visit its website.

        <h3 class="hgoldenp">Golden Gate Park</h3>
        <p class="goldenp">
          If California had a Central Park equivalent, Golden Gate Park would
          undoubtedly be it. Though Golden Gate Park sees a small fraction of
          the visitor's its New York counterpart does (Central Park welcomes
          upward of 25 million, while Golden Gate sees more than 13 million
          yearly), it's about 174 acres bigger (Central Park is 843 acres). The
          park offers so much to see and do, it could take an entire day to
          experience all that it has to offer. Trails, picturesque picnic
          spaces, playgrounds, sports courts, gardens, museums and more can be
          found within its evergreen borders. With so many options available,
          it's best to map out ahead of time what you want to do, though some
          attractions warrant a visit, regardless of traveler taste. The
          Japanese Tea Garden is one of those standout sites. This attraction is
          one of a kind, serving as the oldest Japanese Garden in the USA. It
          features five acres of manicured gardens outfitted with cherry trees,
          bamboo-lined pathways, koi ponds, a five-story pagoda, Zen Garden and
          actual tea house, among other features. There's also the Conservatory
          of Flowers, the oldest existing public conservatory in the Western
          Hemisphere. The conservatory offers visitors a look at a plethora of
          vibrantly colored blooms and a chance to learn more about the nearly
          2,000 species of plants that call the conservatory home.
        </p>
        <h3 class="hyerba">Yerba Buena Gardens</h3>
        <p class="yerba">
          After a day of hasty sightseeing, the Yerba Buena Gardens provide
          travelers with an opportunity to wind down and enjoy San Francisco's
          weather and unique culture. The gardens proper include 5 acres of
          landscaped lawns complete with flowers, trees, water and art. The
          Cho-En Butterfly Garden attracts native San Francisco butterflies with
          plants (also native) that encourage butterfly growth from eggs to
          adults. Meanwhile, the Reflection Garden serves as a tribute to the
          Ohlone Indians as well as a performance area for various oral
          traditions. The Upper Terrace Garden and the Sister City Gardens,
          which include plants from San Francisco's 18 Sister Cities from around
          the world, are where visitors will find the area's cafes and most of
          its seating. Additionally, the East Garden houses a variety of
          sculptures and water features. Lastly, three of the Yerba Buena
          Gardens' lawns boast designs meant to appeal specifically to children.
          What's more, attractions like the Children's Creativity Museum and the
          Yerba Buena Ice Skating + Bowling Center flank the Yerba Buena
          Gardens, so travelers could feasibly spend an entire day exploring
          this area of San Francisco. Due to the number of restaurants that also
          surround the gardens, many past travelers recommend stopping by the
          Yerba Buena Gardens after grabbing lunch nearby. Recent visitors
          recommend checking out the Martin Luther King Jr. memorial as well.
          Plus, the attraction's location in the SoMa neighborhood makes it easy
          to reach from many tourist hot spots. The Powell Street Station of the
          BART public transit system will put travelers a short walk from the
          center of the park. The attraction is open daily from 6 a.m. to 10
          p.m. Be sure to check the Yerba Buena Gardens website before your
          visit for information on public performances and other events.

        <h3 class="halcatraz">Alcatraz</h3>
        <p class="alcatraz">
          While riding a cable car and getting a snap of the Golden Gate is a
          must when visiting San Francisco, both visitors and travel experts
          tend to argue the same for Alcatraz. This is because Alcatraz is rich
          with history. Sitting on a small, rocky island in the middle of San
          Francisco Bay, Alcatraz is most known as being a former federal prison
          that housed some of society's biggest offenders, the most famous of
          which was Prohibition-era mob boss Al Capone. Before that, it was a
          military prison that housed prisoners from the Spanish-American War
          and Civil War, as well as the site of the West Coast's first operating
          lighthouse. The prison closed down both times due to high operating
          costs and was handed over to the National Park Service in 1972 after
          the island experienced a short occupation from Native American
          activists. Today, the attraction sees about one million visitors per
          year. Recent visitors said Alcatraz is truly a can't-miss attraction.
          Travelers enjoyed being able to get up close to cells and said the
          audio tour (complimentary with ferry tickets) voiced by inmates and
          prison guards made the visit that much more fun and informative.
          What's more, travelers say the view of the bay from The Rock (the
          nickname given to Alcatraz) is breathtaking.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h3 class="hcable">Cable Cars</h3>
        <p class="cable">
          Chances are you've seen a television show, movie, postcard or some
          type of San Francisco memorabilia emblazoned with the city's iconic
          cable car or trolley. So of course, to fully experience San
          Francisco's charm, you should hop on board. San Francisco's cable car
          system is the last of its kind in the United States, given the title
          of a National Historic Landmark in 1964. The cable car was conceived
          after Andrew Smith Hallidie, an immigrant from England, witnessed an
          accident involving a horse-drawn buggy trying to climb a steep San
          Francisco hill and failing. His father had a patent for wire rope in
          England and he used that to design a transportation system that relied
          on just that. Thus, cable cars were born in the late 1800s. Though
          cable cars are seldom used by locals (due in part to their small
          travel network and high fare), tourists flock to them in droves. More
          than nine million visitors ride the cable cars each year, and
          according to recent travelers, it's easy to see why. Tourists had a
          blast riding the cable cars up and down San Francisco's vibrant
          streets. Many say the way to get the most out of your cable car
          experience is to ride hanging out of the vehicle. Even though some
          said they encountered long lines to board, the majority of visitors
          believe the wait to be worth the experience. Though if you're not one
          for long lines, some say to board at one of the stops along the line
          instead at the beginning.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h3 class="htwin">Twin Peaks</h3>
        <p class="twin">
          If you want the best views of San Francisco, take a hike to Twin
          Peaks. These famous grassy pounds rise 922 feet from the ground,
          making them the second highest point in the city (after Mount
          Davidson). From the top, travelers can view multiple San Francisco
          landmarks, including the Bay Bridge and the downtown skyscrapers.
          Whether you decide to go during the day or night (some say you should
          do both), numerous visitors agree that the views are stunning and
          worth the trek. But make sure to bring a jacket: many recent visitors
          said it can get windier (and subsequently chillier) up top than at sea
          level. The Twin Peaks are open 5 a.m. to midnight and there is free
          (albeit limited) parking at the top of Twin Peaks Boulevard. The
          Castro Street station is the nearest Muni Metro stop and the Crestline
          Drive stop on the No. 37 is the best bus route (picks up from Market
          Street). Be sure to stay on marked trails, as poison ivy can be found
          in the area. For more information, visit the San Francisco Recreation
          and Parks website.

        <h3 class="hcastro">The Castro</h3>
        <p class="castro">
          If you want to explore San Francisco's rich gay and lesbian culture,
          the Castro neighborhood is its beating heart. Not only is the Castro
          the center of the city's LGBTQ community, but it's considered by many
          to be the gay capital of the world. And once you learn the Castro's
          history, it's easy to see why. In the 1970s, the Castro was home to
          Harvey Milk, California's first openly gay public official and one of
          the first in the USA. His steadfast efforts in the gay rights movement
          not only earned him the title the "Mayor of Castro Street," but his
          political efforts helped put San Francisco at the forefront of the gay
          rights movement. His former camera shop, Castro Camera, that also
          served as his campaign headquarters, still stands on Castro Street and
          now serves as a Human Rights Campaign retail shop. Visitors found the
          Castro laid-back, fun and above all colorful, citing its friendly
          residents, plentiful amenities and striking aesthetics as its best
          assets.The neighborhood is lined with picturesque Victorian homes,
          previously built by immigrants who moved to the Castro in the 19th
          century seeking cheap land (the area was once a dairy farm). Travelers
          say a stop at Harvey Milk's old camera shop is a must, even if there
          is only a plaque commemorating his presence there now. Those wanting
          to delve further into the neighborhood's history should head on over
          to the GLBT Museum on 18th street. The unmissable Castro Theatre,
          situated along the neighborhood's main drag, is another neighborhood
          gem and a registered city landmark.

        <h3 class="hbaker">Baker Beach</h3>
        <p class="baker">
          While San Francisco isn't known for being a beach town, the city's
          Baker Beach is often considered one of the best in California. Located
          in the northwestern area of San Francisco in the Presidio, Baker Beach
          is primarily known for its sweeping views of the Golden Gate Bridge
          and the neighboring Marin Headlands. The mile-long beach offers
          travelers plenty of room to spread their legs and features picnic
          areas and access to nearby Presidio trails. Travelers flock here to
          snap photos of the bridge, however, if you're looking to catch some
          rays or get your feet wet, you should go elsewhere: Swimming at Baker
          Beach is dangerous thanks to large waves, undertow and rip currents,
          and the city's fickle weather means it's not always warm enough for
          sunbathing. Travelers strongly recommend bringing an extra layer, no
          matter what time of year you visit. Reviewers also stress that those
          traveling with families should stick to the south side of the beach:
          North Baker Beach is clothing optional, and it's definitely practiced.

        <h3 class="hferry">Ferry Building Marketplace</h3>
        <p class="ferry">
          Attention all foodies: this delectable attraction needs to be at the
          top of your San Francisco to-do list. The Ferry Building Marketplace
          is a public food market that features a variety of food stalls that
          act as small restaurants, snack stops and grocery stores. Here you can
          find everything from staples, such as seafood, burgers, Mexican food
          and plenty of coffee, to a Japanese delicatessen, empanada stand, nut
          shop and a cheese and dairy bar. Many travelers who stopped by the
          Ferry Building Marketplace visited multiple times during their San
          Francisco trip. Visitors were impressed with the amount, variety and
          overall quality of eats available on-site. Though there are formal
          restaurants available, some visitors say the best strategy is to pick
          up a to-go meal and enjoy it along the scenic waterfront. And if
          you're not one for lines, don't come on the weekends. For a different
          perspective of the marketplace, view it from the water on a narrated
          boat tour.

        <h3 class="hchina">China Town</h3>
        <p class="china">
          While New York City's Chinatown tends to take center stage in the USA,
          San Francisco's Chinatown is just as much of a star. San Francisco's
          Chinatown hosts one of the largest Asian communities outside of Asia,
          and is considered one the oldest in North America. Chinese immigrants
          first started coming to California in search of fortune during the
          Gold Rush. After being driven out of the gold mines (due to
          discrimination and restrictive legislation against Chinese
          immigrants), the Chinese moved to build businesses of their own in the
          area that is now Chinatown – one of the city's most visited
          neighborhoods. The best way to experience Chinatown is to simply
          wander around the neighborhood. Chinatown isn't very big (about 24
          blocks), so even a short stroll will likely get you to top spots in
          the neighborhood.

        <h3 class="hunion">Union Square</h3>
        <p class="union">
          Situated a couple blocks north of Market Street and southwest of the
          city's Financial District, Union Square sits at the heart of downtown
          San Francisco's hustle and bustle. This area is loved by travelers and
          locals alike for its awesome location and incredible energy. Union
          Square Park is flanked by tall buildings (some of which are adorned
          with Time Square-size ads) and busy streets, offering people the
          unique opportunity to sit in the middle of a busy city and enjoy the
          atmosphere without the risk of getting run over. The square also acts
          as a park, outfitted with small grassy spaces and palm trees. There
          are also multiple seating areas and works of art dotted across the
          square. The most recognized are the tall Dewey monument, situated in
          the center of the square, and the regularly photographed Hearts of San
          Francisco sculpture found at the base of the square Travelers
          appreciated the abundance of amenities that surround Union Square.
          There are plenty of hotels as well as dining options left and right.
          Union Square is pretty well-known, however, for its shopping. Just
          blocks away shoppers will find everything from Neiman Marcus to a
          multi-level Forever 21. Recent visitors agreed this is a great place
          to shop but warn against driving through the area. While there is
          parking underneath the square, some drivers find the roads around
          Union Square to be so congested that braving the traffic is not worth
          the convenient parking. Getting to Union Square via public
          transportation is much easier. The attraction sits just blocks from
          Market Street, a hub for all types of public transportation including
          the bus, Muni Metro and BART. Union Square is only two blocks
          southeast from the Market St. & 3rd St. Muni Station and about four
          blocks south of the Powel Street BART Station. Union Square can be
          visited all hours of the day and night for free. For more information
          on Union Square, visit the attraction's website.

        <p class="lombard">
          Fans of zigging and zagging and charming thoroughfares will appreciate
          Lombard Street, an exceptionally crooked street in northern San
          Francisco. Victorian mansions line the street, while beautiful flowers
          and landscaped shrubbery fill the space between its eight switchbacks.
          While the road runs from east to west for the length of the city, the
          portion between Hyde and Leavenworth streets is the section worth
          exploring. Travelers can walk along each direction of Lombard Street,
          or opt to drive down it instead. The top of this iconic road boasts
          stellar views, though recent travelers still express mixed opinions on
          whether the heavily trafficked street warrants a visit. One tip
          travelers recommend: Taking the cable car to the attraction, which
          stops at the top of the hill (at the intersection of Hyde and Lombard
          streets). From the elevated view, you can gaze at the winding street
          as automobiles queue up for the quick drive down. You'll find Lombard
          Street just south of Fisherman's Wharf; it's free to visit.

        <h3 class="hland">Lands End</h3>
        <p class="land">
          One of the top places in San Francisco to catch the sunset, Lands End
          offers whimsical, winding trails through rocky cliffs. Located in the
          northwestern corner of San Francisco, the park sits inside of the
          Golden Gate National Recreation Area. The park encompasses multiple
          historic sites, monuments, a golf course, multiple trails and a
          shoreline labyrinth with excellent views of the Golden Gate Bridge.
          Past visitors appreciated the historic ruins of the Sutro Baths, which
          San Franciscans used as a recreational swimming facility from 1898 to
          1964. The baths were demolished in 1964, then further destroyed by a
          fire in 1996, leaving the structure that travelers can visit today.
          Similarly, the park's iconic Cliff House was destroyed twice by fire,
          but it was rebuilt each time. Now, the Cliff House offers a space for
          travelers to enjoy a meal or drink. The heart of Lands End is the Land
          End Lookout visitor center, which is open daily from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.
          and includes exhibits and videos on the nature and cultural history of
          the area. Entrance to the park and the visitor center are free.
          Cultural enthusiasts will want to stop by the nearby Legion of Honor
          museum as well, which houses multiple eras of European art. The Legion
          of Honor is open Tuesday to Sunday from 9:30 a.m. to 5:15 p.m.
          Admission costs $15 for adults, $12 for seniors, $6 for students and
          is free for children 17 and younger.

        <p class="fisherman">
          Fisherman's Wharf is so tourist-laden that some travelers might prefer
          the quieter, more authentic attractions nearby (like the Castro or
          Golden Gate Park). But if you're looking to explore all of San
          Francisco – from its alternative underbelly to its mainstream
          attractions – Fisherman's Wharf really is a must-see. This waterfront
          neighborhood features a laundry list of things to do, as well as a few
          popular San Francisco sites. One of these is Pier 39. The Pier
          features plenty of shopping and restaurant options for tourists and is
          also famous for offering sweeping views of the bay, as well as the
          can't-miss attractions that call it home, including Alcatraz and the
          Golden Gate Bridge. Though while you're there, don't miss an
          opportunity to snap a photo of the sea lions who have a habit of
          sunbathing on buoys near the docks. The Wharf also houses plenty of
          family-friendly attractions and activities, including a Madame
          Tussauds wax museum, Ripley's Believe It or Not!, the San Francisco
          Dungeon and the Aquarium of the Bay, the last three of which can be
          found on Pier 39. Those with an interest in history will want to
          explore the San Francisco Maritime National Historic Park and its
          Maritime Museum. When you start to feel peckish, head over to
          Ghirardelli Square, which is home to the original Ghirardelli Ice
          Cream & Chocolate shop. There's also Boudin's, another San Francisco
          institution. Boudin's is the original creator of sourdough French
          bread as well as the oldest bakery in the city of San Francisco.

        <h3 class="hdisney">The Walt Disney Family Museum</h3>
        <p class="disney">
          True Disney aficionados would be remiss to skip The Walt Disney Family
          Museum, which delves into the history around the iconic creator. The
          museum's galleries begin with Walt Disney's childhood and trace his
          life through the construction of Disneyland, highlighting his legacy
          and various achievements along the way. Rotating exhibitions widen the
          museum's berth and offer a closer look at the artists and animators
          who helped inspire classic characters such as Pinocchio and Mickey
          Mouse. Past visitors were impressed by how thoroughly the museum
          explains Walt Disney's early life. They also praised the museum's
          interactive displays, saying that there is a good mix of reading and
          video to keep museum patrons entertained. The Walt Disney Family
          Museum sits in the Presidio, in the northern part of San Francisco.
          Metered parking is available throughout the neighborhood, while
          travelers can also take the free PresidiGo Shuttle, plus the No. 45,
          43 and 28 buses stop near the attraction. The museum is open from 10
          a.m. to 6 p.m. Wednesday through Monday, excluding major holidays, and

          youths ages 6 to 17; children 5 and younger and military personnel are
          granted free entry. Film screenings and special exhibition venues cost
