          to this part of the US to see the Hollywood Sign, walk on the
          Hollywood Walk of Fame or through Beverly Hills, spend a day at a
          theme park, and more!
          <br />

        <p class="1">
          One of the most iconic landmarks in Los Angeles, the Hollywood Walk of
          Fame officially opened in 1960 with the placement of the first eight
          stars. Years later, it has over 2500 stars on its famous sidewalk. The
          Walk of Fame spans 15 blocks of Hollywood Boulevard and three blocks
          of Vine Street. The brass stars, embedded in pink and charcoal
          terrazzo squares, immortalize the figures of Hollywood's entertainment
          industry. From musicians and actors to directors and even fictional
          characters, the stars are permanent public monuments to each
          entertainer's achievements. Although it can get crowded, it's fun
          trying to find your favorite stars. It's also one of the best things
          to do in LA at night!

          Since its opening in 1922, the Hollywood Bowl has hosted the world's
          most outstanding performers, from Stevie Wonder to The Beatles. It is
          one of the most famous landmarks in Los Angeles and one of the most
          renowned outdoor venues in the country. Make sure to participate in
          Southern California's annual Playboy Jazz Festival, a beloved music
          tradition. The famous acoustic shell is an incredible sight,
          especially during spectacular fireworks displays. You can check out
          the Muse of Music, Dance, a Drama sculpture, and a fountain at the

          4,100 acres of natural wilderness, making it the largest urban park in
          the United States. From here, you can get a spectacular view of the

          Lucas' Star Wars and three Academy Award ceremonies. It also possesses
          the single largest IMAX theater globally. Designed to resemble a
          Chinese pagoda, the theatre has a Chinese dragon on the exterior as
          well. Be sure to visit the famous Forecourt of the Stars too. This is
          one of the most iconic landmarks in Los Angeles. It contains nearly

        <p class="6">
          Within Hancock Park, La Brea Tar Pits are a group of tar pits inside
          an urban location. These tar pits have drawn in scientists and
          visitors from all over the world. Over the last 50,000 years, animals
          and plants, from giant mammoths and sloths to tiny remains and
          microfossils, have been preserved in the sticky asphalt. Today, this
          area is the only actively excavated Ice Age fossil site located in an
          urban area. Since the early 1900s, excavations have been made at the
          Tar Pits, with most of the findings housed in the La Brea Tar Pits
          Museum. The fossils give us a look into ancient ecosystems and
          climates.

        <p class="7">
          LACMA (the Los Angeles County Museum of Art) broke off from the Los
          Angeles Museum of History, Science, and Art in 1961. Opening to the
          public in 1965 in a new location, LACMA offers a permanent collection
          and special exhibitions. Currently, LACMA is the largest art museum in
          California, exhibiting thousands of pieces from across the globe and
          history. Its diverse collections represent the region's equally
          diverse cultural heritage and community. Lastly, outside the entrance
          of the museum are the Urban Lights, which is one of the most iconic
          landmarks in Los Angeles for a photo-op!

          Established just north of the Walk of Fame and designed by Welton
          Becket, the tower resembles a stack of records and is the world's
          first circular office building. The red-lit spire on top of the
          building blinks "Hollywood" in Morse code. Additionally, on the south
          wall of the building, you can see the Hollywood Jazz Mural entitled
          "Hollywood Jazz: 1945-1972", which pictures several notable jazz

          Constructed in 1939, the Los Angeles Union Station emerged as a
          gateway to the Californian dream. As cars and planes became more
          common, fewer passengers traveled through the station. However, it
          remained the transportation center of LA for decades. Its historic
          significance designated it as a Los Angeles Historic-Cultural Monument
          in 1972 and placed it on the National Register of Historic Places in
          1980. Presently, the station is the hub of trains, subways, buses, and
          coach services. As you wait for your transport, you can admire the
          unique and beautiful architecture here!

          Town of Our Lady, the Queen of Angels of the River Porciúncula." Built
          to replace the Cathedral of Saint Vibiana, which was severely damaged
          in the 1994 Northridge earthquake, construction began in 1998. You can

          The Watts Towers is a collection of steel towers within the artist's
          original residency in Watts. The entire site, including the buildings,
          structures, sculptures, pavement, and walls, was designed and built by
          a lone Italian immigrant construction worker in his spare time. Over
          33 years, he labored over them until their completion in 1954. These
          towers were designated as a historic landmark both nationally,
          regionally, and locally in 1990. The sheer size of these Los Angeles
          landmark buildings makes it worth a visit!
