        <p class="introduction">
          An enduring symbol of the Mojave Desert, Yucca brevifolia might be the
          namesake of this national park in the desert east of Los Ange­les, but
          it’s certainly far from the only thing to see at Joshua Tree. Dozens
          of trails are open to hiking, biking, and horseback riding, and the
          stony terrain makes it one of America’s rock­climbing meccas. Spring
          brings a carpet of wildflow­ers. And the superclear desert night sky
          makes the park an oasis for stargazing.
          <br />
          <br />
          The park embraces parts of two distinct deserts—the Mojave and
          Sonoran—as it tumbles down from the heights into the Coachella Valley
          near Palm Springs. These two desert systems divide California's
          southernmost national park into two arid ecosystems of profoundly
          contrasting appearance. The key to their differences is elevation.
        </p>

        <p class="i2">
          The Colorado, the western reach of the vast Sonoran Desert, thrives
          below 3,000 feet on the park’s gently declining eastern flank, where
          temperatures are usually higher. Considered “low desert,” compared to
          the loftier, wetter, and more vegetated Mojave “high desert,” the
          Colorado seems sparse and forbidding. It begins at the park’s
          midsection, sweeping east across empty basins stubbled with creosote
          bushes. Occasionally decorated by “gardens” of flowering ocotillo and
          cholla cactus, it runs across arid Pinto Basin into a parched
          wilderness of broken rock in the Eagle and Coxcomb Mountains.
          <br />
          <br />
          Many newcomers among the 1.3 million visitors who pass through each
          year are surprised by the abrupt transition between the Colorado and
          Mojave ecosystems. Above 3,000 feet, the Mojave section claims the
          park’s western half, where giant branching yuccas thrive on sandy
          plains studded by massive granite monoliths and rock piles. These are
          among the most intriguing and photogenic geological phenomena found in
          California’s many desert regions.
        </p>
        <p class="i3">
          Joshua Tree’s human history commenced sometime after the last ice age
          with the arrival of the Pinto people, hunter-gatherers who may have
          been part of the Southwest’s earliest cultures. They lived in Pinto
          Basin, which though inhospitably arid today, had a wet climate and was
          crossed by a sluggish river some 5,000 to 7,000 years ago. Nomadic
          groups of Indians seasonally inhabited the region when harvests of
          pinyon nuts, mesquite beans, acorns, and cactus fruit offered
          sustenance. Bedrock mortars—holes ground into solid rock and used to
          pulverize seeds during food preparation—are scattered throughout the
          Wonderland of Rocks area south of the Indian Cove camping site.
        </p>
        <p class="i4">
          A flurry of late 19th-century gold-mining ventures left ruins; some
          are accessible by hiking trails, or unmaintained roads suited only to
          four-wheel-drive vehicles and mountain bikes.
          <br />
          <br />
          There are only three ways visitors can enter the park: from Yucca
          Valley in the west, Twenty­nine Palms in the north, and Cottonwood
          Springs in the south. The main Visitor Center is actu­ally outside the
          park, in the nearby town of Joshua Tree. Although the name seems like
          an oxymoron, Park Boulevard runs from the visitor cen­ter to Lost
          Horse Valley in the heart of the park, where three short interpretive
          trails (Hidden Valley, Barker Dam, and Cap Rock) are a great
          introduction to Joshua Tree’s natural and human history.
          <br />
          <br />
          More challenging trails can be accessed from the Hidden Valley area,
          including the eight-­mile Boy Scout Trail into the boul­der­strewn
          Wonderland of Rocks and the 35­-mile California Riding and Hiking
          Trail (normally done as a two­- or three-day backpack trip). Another
          trail ascends to the summit of 5,456­-foot Ryan Mountain. Or cruise
          the paved road to Keys View at the crest of the Little San Bernardino
          Mountains for a mile-­high vista of the Coachella Valley, Salton Sea,
          and San Andreas Fault—a view that’s especially enchanting after dark
          when Palm Springs sparkles with millions of lights.
          <br />
          Park Boulevard continues over Sheep Pass into Queen Valley and another
          Joshua tree forest. The 18-­mile Motor Geology Road runs south through
          the valley, with 16 stops along the way that explain how the park’s
          dramatic landscape was formed. Anchoring the valley’s eastern edge is
          eerie Skull Rock, a natural formation that looks like a skeleton’s
          head. Exiting the valley, Park Boule­vard makes a sharp turn to the
          north and a rendezvous with a lush palm grove, the Oasis of Mara,
          located beside the Oasis Visitor Center.
