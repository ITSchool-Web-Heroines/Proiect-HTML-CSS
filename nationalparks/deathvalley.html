        <p class="introduction">
          This remarkable and legendary landscape is alive with unmatched beauty
          characterized with miles and miles of huge sand dunes, technicolor
          rocks and canyons, rare and endemic wildlife, one-of-a-kind
          evaporative elements, and jaw-dropping peaks rising 11,000 feet above
          neighboring valley. A visit to Death Valley National Park promises a
          lifetime of unexpected discovery. Visitors to Death Valley National
          Park will also find a wreath of relics from its long history that
          offer a glimpse into the harsh life of the area’s early settlers and
          native inhabitants, including metal ore mines, charcoal kilns, ghost
          towns, petroglyphs, and ancient Shoshone foot trails. But first, where
          is Death Valley, anyway? The fascinating desert valley is situated on
          the eastern border of south-central California, in the northern Mojave
          Desert, and borders the Great Basin Desert. The area of Death Valley
          National covers 5,270 square miles (3.4 million acres), stretching
          into Nevada, and is the largest national park in the Lower 48.
        </p>
        <p class="introduction2">
          This striking southwestern landscape has long been ancestral land to
          the Timbisha Shoshone Tribe, who lived in and around modern-day Death
          Valley, Ash Springs, the Inyo Mountains, and other places in Mono
          County, California and Nye, Mineral, and Esmeralda Counties in Nevada.
          In 1849, a group of early pioneers looking for an easy shortcut on
          their way to California goldfields took what turned out to be a
          fictitious southern route through this incomparably hot and dry
          region. After months of hardship, the parties split. One made it
          (barely) to civilization while the other only did after more months
          waiting for two young men to walk 300 miles and return with horses.
          While only one man actually succumbed during their wait, one member is
          said to have looked back on the place one last time and proclaimed,
          “Goodbye, Death Valley.” And so it would forever be known.

          Death Valley Elevation: Badwater Basin to Telescope Peak and Beyond
        </h3>
        <p class="elevation">
          Death Valley’s fascinating features stretch a baffling 130 miles long
          by 12 miles wide. What’s even more astounding is the fact that Death
          Valley covers a staggering 3.4 million acres of rugged, mostly
          unpopulated terrain that is filled with sweeps of desert broken up by
          towering mountains and rocky ridges. The elevation to the north end
          sits at about 3,000 feet and slopes steadily downward, putting the
          valley floor below sea level for 70 miles. Ultimately, the terrain
          bottoms out just beyond Artist’s Drive at Badwater Basin—the lowest,
          hottest and driest point in the Western Hemisphere—sitting at a
          whopping 282 feet below sea level. This stark depression contributes
          to the equally extreme temperatures, which can climb to a scorching
          130°F during summer days and dip to below 0°F on winter (or even other
          seasons’) nights.

        <h3 class="hexplore">Explore Death Valley Sand Dunes and Salt Flats</h3>
        <p class="explore">
          When visiting Death Valley for the first time, it’s easy to expect a
          sea of sand, right? You’re not wrong—at least about certain places,
          including one of the most famous sand dunes in the country is found
          within Death Valley’s borders, Mesquite Flat Sand Dunes. While
          recreation in Death Valley’s sand dunes is allowed, off-road vehicles,
          sledding, and sand skiing are forbidden in most places to protect the
          fragile desert ecology.

          Experience Death Valley Seasonal Wildflower
        </h3>
        <p class="experience">
          Blooms Death Valley is renowned for stunning super blooms of spring
          wildflower exhibits, but not every year. When perfect conditions
          happen, the desert fills with a sea of purple, gold, pink, and white
          wildflowers. A good wildflower year depends on at least three things:
          spread-out rain through the winter and spring, enough warmth from the
          sun, and light to non-existent harsh desert winds. The park will know
          ahead of time if conditions are right to produce a seasonal bloom, or
          even a world-famous Death Valley Superbloom, but you can typically
          plan for there to be seasonal blooms from February to April in lower
          elevations, early April and May from the 3,000 to 5,000 feet of
          elevation, and May to July for elevations beyond 5,000 feet.

          Death Valley Wildlife
        </h3>
        <p class="wildlife">
          Death Valley is a refuge to 400 animal species, and the key to their
          existence is their ability to adapt in the harsh Death Valley climate.
          At five feet long and three feet tall at the shoulder, the largest of
          these animals is the desert bighorn sheep. Thanks to a year-round
          freshwater spring that feeds their watering hole, Titus Canyon is one
          of the best places to look for these desert bighorn in Death Valley.
          On the other end of the animal spectrum, the kangaroo rat is one of
          Death Valley’s best-adapted animals which uses its powerful hind legs
          to communicate through thumps and to jump as far as nine feet in a
          single bound.
