        <p class="introduction">
          Yosemite National Park is an American national park in
          California,[6][7] surrounded on the southeast by Sierra National
          Forest and on the northwest by Stanislaus National Forest. The park is
          managed by the National Park Service and covers an area of 759,620
          acres (1,187 sq mi; 3,074 km2)[3] and sits in four counties â€“ centered
          in Tuolumne and Mariposa, extending north and east to Mono and south
          to Madera County. Designated a World Heritage Site in 1984, Yosemite
          is internationally recognized for its granite cliffs, waterfalls,
          clear streams, giant sequoia groves, lakes, mountains, meadows,
          glaciers, and biological diversity.[8] Almost 95 percent of the park
          is designated wilderness.[9] Yosemite is one of the largest and least
          fragmented habitat blocks in the Sierra Nevada, and the park supports
          a diversity of plants and animals.
        </p>
        <p class="i2">
          The geology of the Yosemite area is characterized by granite rocks and
          remnants of older rock. About 10 million years ago, the Sierra Nevada
          was uplifted and tilted to form its unique slopes, which increased the
          steepness of stream and river beds, resulting in the formation of
          deep, narrow canyons. About one million years ago glaciers formed at
          higher elevations which eventually melted and moved downslope, cutting
          and sculpting the U-shaped valley that attracts so many visitors to
          its scenic vistas today.[8]
        </p>
        <p class="i3">
          The Yosemite Valley itself was discovered by European American
          settlers in 1851. There are earlier instances of other travelers
          entering the Valley but James D. Savage is accredited with discovering
          the area that is now known as Yosemite National Park.[10] Despite
          Savage and other white men claiming their discovery of Yosemite, the
          region and Valley itself has been inhabited for nearly 4,000 years,
          although humans may have first visited the area as long as 8,000 to
          10,000 years ago.[11][12]
        </p>
        <p class="i4">
          Yosemite was critical to the development of the national park idea.
          Galen Clark and others lobbied to protect Yosemite Valley from
          development, ultimately leading to President Abraham Lincoln signing
          the Yosemite Grant of 1864 which declared Yosemite as federally
          preserved land.[13] It was not until 1890 when John Muir led a
          successful movement which had Congress establish Yosemite Valley and
          its surrounding areas as a National Park. This helped pave the way for
          the National Park System.[13] Yosemite now draws about four million
          visitors each year,[14] and most visitors spend the majority of their
          time in the seven square miles (18 km2) of Yosemite Valley.[8] The
          park set a visitation record in 2016, surpassing five million visitors
          for the first time in its history.[15] The park began requiring
          reservations to access the park during peak periods starting in 2020
          as a response to the rise in visitors.
