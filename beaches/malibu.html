        <p class="i1">
          With nearly three-dozen beaches to choose from, Malibu is a
          beach-lovers dream. From the iconic Surfrider Beach, famous for
          world-class surfing and movies like “Gidget”, to one of the area’s
          cleanest beaches at Zuma Beach, to the cave-like rocks and cliffs of
          El Matador State Beach, there are plenty of options. Keep in mind,
          though, many of these beaches aren’t very well known, or easy to find.
          Some do not make it easy for the public to get to either.
        </p>
        <p class="i2">
          El Matador Beach is one of three beaches within Robert H. Meyer
          Memorial State Beach and it is the jewel of Malibu. The parking lots
          for each beach are well-signed along Pacific Coast Highway in western
          Malibu. El Matador has a parking lot on the bluff with picnic tables
          that look out over the Pacific Ocean. A trail descends through unique
          eroding formations on the face of the bluff then stairs take you the
          rest of the way to the beach. Beautiful sea stacks are on the beach
          and in the surf. This is a popular spot for pro photographers to shoot
          swimsuit models and stunning sunsets. Explore north on the beach to
          caves and arches in the rocks. The largest cave faces the ocean at the
          bottom of a huge flat rock that is connected to the base of the bluff.
          It’s best to visit these natural features at low tide. Continuing your
          walk north leads to La Piedra State Beach. If you walk south you will
          pass in front of stunning homes on your way to Lechuza Beach.
        </p>
        <p class="i3">
          Another famous beach is the Malibu Surfrider Beach, which is the
          well-known sandy beach and surfing spot between the Malibu Pier and
          the Malibu Lagoon. Surfrider Beach is part of Malibu Lagoon State
          Beach which has another parking lot next to the lagoon just west on
          Pacific Coast Highway. The name Surfrider suggests good surfing waves
          for riding, and with a super long right hand break, it’s an accurate
          name. The Malibu Sport Fishing Pier is a comfortable spot to hang out
          on with many benches and nice views. Malibu Farm has a restaurant at
          the entrance to the pier and a cafe at the end of the pier. A sand
          volleyball court is near the pier and lifeguards are on hand during
          peak times to watch for kids and swimmers. There are separate swimming
          and surfing designated areas. Adamson House and Malibu Lagoon Museum
          (local history and the birth of surfing) is at the parking lot located
          at 23200 Pacific Coast Highway. The nearby lagoon has trails and is an
          excellent birding location. For Surfrider Beach find a parking spot
          along PCH or in the lot with entrance at the Adamson House.
